# Dataflows Power Automate Connector 
In this **[POST]** you can read about the new connector to:
* Trigger a flow when a dataflow refresh completes
* Take action to initiate a dataflow refresh

In this blog, we are going to discuss some use cases with corresponding templates, to quickstart the use of this connector. We are going to discuss the following templates:

Notifications:
* Send an email notification when a dataflow refresh status changes
* Send email notification on success or failure of a dataflow
* When a dataflow refresh status changes, sends a Teams notification

Support tickets:
* When a dataflow refresh fails, send a message to service bus queue to open a support ticket

Refresh Dataflows/Datasets sequentially:
* When you click on button, initiate a dataflow refresh
* When an analytical dataflow refresh succeeds, initiate a standard dataflow refresh
* When a dataflow refresh succeeds, initiate a Power BI dataset refresh
* When a file in SharePoint gets updated, initiate a dataflow refresh

Save dataflow refresh meta-data:
* When a dataflow refresh completes, save meta-data to Dataverse Table
* When a dataflow refresh completes, save meta-data to Exel online
* When a dataflow refresh completes, save meta-data to Power BI Streaming dataset

# Examples

## Notifications
### Use Case
When your dataflow refresh completes, you, or other people who manage or depend on the dataflow, want to get an email, teams, or other type of notification to alert you that the dataflow refresh completed and/or of its status. This way, you know your data is up to date and you can start getting new insights. Another common scenario is not get notified when a dataflow refresh failed. This way you can idediately start ivestigating the problem and alert people that depend on the data being refreshed.

### Using the templates
For sending notifications, we published three templates:
* Send an email notification when a dataflow refresh status changes
* Send email notification on success or failure of a dataflow
* When a dataflow refresh status changes, sends a Teams notification

Let's take a look at the second template:
* Navigate to [Power Automate Portal](https://flow.microsoft.com)
* Search for the template **Send email notification on succes or failure of a data flow refresh**, by following these [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-automate/get-started-logic-template)

![An example of folder structure](images/emailyesyno.PNG)

* Customize the flow
    Actions that require your input will automatically be expanded.

   The **Dataflow Refresh** trigger is expanded because you need to enter *Dataflow*. You need to enter the following information:
    * **Group Type**: Choose *Environment* when connection to Power Apps and *Workspace* when connecting to Power BI
    * **Group**: Select the Power Apps environment or the Power BI workspace your dataflow is in
    * **Dataflow**: Select your dataflow by name

After the condition, you can specify what happens after succes or failure of the dataflow. In this template in both cases, an email will be sent with the status of the dataflow refresh.

![An example of folder structure](images/isyes.PNG)

Note: you can modify the email content or flow.

## Support Tickets

### Use Cases
When your dataflow refresh completes, or has been taking longer than expected, you might want to open a support ticket/create a message in a que or service bus, so your support team can take a look at the issue.

### Using the Templates

Let's look at the template where we want to add a message to the queue, when a dataflow refresh failed. In this template, we make use of Azure Service Bus. To create an Azure Service bus and create a Queue follow these [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-quickstart-portal#create-a-namespace-in-the-azure-portal).

* Navigate to [Power Automate Portal](https://flow.microsoft.com)
* Search for the template **when a dataflow refresh failes, add a new message to the queue**, by following these [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/get-started-logic-template)

![An example of folder structure](images/servicebuscondition.PNG)

* Customize the flow
    Actions that require input from you will automatically be expanded.

   The **Dataflow Refresh** trigger is expanded because you need to enter *Dataflow*. You need to enter the following information:
    * **Group Type**: Choose *Environment* when connecting to Power Apps and *Workspace* when connecting to Power BI
    * **Group**: Select the Power Apps environment or the Power BI workspace you dataflow is in
    * **Dataflow**: Select your dataflow by name

After the condition, you can specify what happens after succes or failure of the dataflow. In this template in both cases, we send you an email with the status of the dataflow refresh.

![An example of folder structure](images/ifyesservice.PNG)

Note: you can modify the message content or flow.

## Trigger Dataflows and Power BI Dataset Sequentially

### Use Cases
There are two very common use cases for how you can use this connector to trigger multiple dataflows and Power BI dataset sequentially.

1. Trigger the refresh of a Standard Dataflow after the succesfull completion of an Analytical Dataflow refresh.

If a dataflow performs all actions, then it is hard to reuse its entities in other dataflows or for other purposes. The best dataflows to reuse are those dataflows doing only a few actions. Creating dataflows that specialize in one specific task is one of the best ways of reusing them. If you have a set of dataflows as staging dataflows, their only action is to extract data "as is" from the source system. These dataflows can be reused in multiple other dataflows. For more information, take a look at the [best practices for reusing datafows](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-query/dataflows/best-practices-reusing-dataflows)

2. Trigger the refresh of a Power BI dataset when a dataflow refresh completed succesfully.

If you want to make sure that your dashboard is directly up-to-date after a dataflow refreshed your data, you can use the connector to trigger the refresh of a Power BI dataset after you dataflow refreshed succesfully.

### Using the Templates

letâ€™s take a look at the first template:
* Navigate to [Power Automate Portal](https://flow.microsoft.com)
* Search for the template **Trigger a dataflow refresh after my dataflow refresgh completed succesfully**, by following these [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-automate/get-started-logic-template)

![An example of folder structure](images/emailyesyno.PNG)

* Customize the flow
    Actions that require input from you will automatically be expanded.

   The **Dataflow Refresh** trigger is expanded because you need to enter *Dataflow*. You need to enter the following information:
    * **Group Type**: Choose *Environment* when connecting to Power Apps and *Workspace* when connecting to Power BI
    * **Group**: Select the Power Apps environment or the Power BI workspace you dataflow is in
    * **Dataflow**: Select your dataflow by name

After the condition, you can specify what happens after success or failure of the dataflow. In this template we trigger a new datafow:

   The **refresh a dataflow** action is expanded because you need to enter *Dataflow*. You need to enter the following information:
    * **Group Type**: Choose *Environment* when connecting to Power Apps and *Workspace* when connecting to Power BI
    * **Group**: Select the Power Apps environment or the Power BI workspace you dataflow is in
    * **Dataflow**: Select your dataflow by name


 # Load Data into Dataverse Table and build a dataflow monitoring report with Power BI
In this step-by-step example we will show you how to set up your own monitoring dashboard for all your dataflows:

![An example of folder structure](images/dashboard.PNG)

You can use this dashboard to monitor your dataflow's refresh duration and failure count. This way you can easily track any issues with your dataflows performance and share with others.

First, we are going to create a new Dataverse table. This table will store all the metadata from the dataflow run. For every refresh of a dataflow, we add a record to this table. We can store metadata for multiple dataflows runs in the same table. When we built the table, we can connect the .pbit file to the Dataverse table.
